xl_util/TODO

2016-06-22
    * makeExRE(wildcards) => compiled regular expression
        from slice of globs
        - xlUtil_go/merkletree must use
        - xlUtil_go/nlhtree must use
    * interoperability Go merkletree with Python merkletree
    * interoperability Go nlhtree with Python nlhtree
    * move SHA{1,2}_NONE from merkletree to nlhtree
        - xlUtil_go/const.go would be better but would cause
            circular references

2016-03-04
    * re popCount.go look at using github.com/hideo55/go-popcount 
        - is it correct?
        - need to test both his go implementation and his assembly
            language code
        - need to be able to detect processor type and use assembly
            code if amd64
        - test on laptop (64 bit Intel CPU), our local network, 
            and EC2 machines

    * BUG IN COUNTEM: gMerkleize.go is not counted because its 
        directory name is filtered

2016-01-17
    * code.google.com is deprecated but cannot determine where 
        intmath/intgr has migrated to, so popCount_test.go continues
        to use it; find out where it has gone to
        - or just copy the code here with an attribution and licensing
            info
    * countem doesn't count gMerkleize because that name is excluded 
        and the source code is in a directory of that name

2015-10-08
    * verify that the command line documented is that actually used
        by gMerkleize
    * modify as required so that insofar as possible the Java, Pyuthon,
        `and Go command line syntax are the same
2014-12-17
    * introduce file format changes (possibly SHA name at end of 
        first line in file) to make distinguishing SHA2 from SHA3 
        possible)
        - python code must adopt the same changes
    * prove interoperability between golang and python3 code

2014-12-11
    * consolidate BitCount32/64() from hamt_go and bit_map_64.go
        into a file under xlUtil_go/math; this will subsume popCount3
        and popCount4(), which are currently not used anywhere else
    * eventually this will become a wrapper around a call to the C 
        language xlattice_c library

2014-11-08
    * mark NextExp2(), NextPow2() deprecated                            * DONE
    * delete in next development cycle

2014-05-10
    * need xlattice_go/cmd/gMerkleize/
