xl_util/TODO

2015-10-08
    * verify that the command line documented is that actually used
        by gMerkleize
    * modify as required so that insofar as possible the Java, Pyuthon,
        `and Go command line syntax are the same
2014-12-17
    * introduce file format changes (possibly SHA name at end of 
        first line in file) to make distinguishing SHA2 from SHA3 
        possible)
        - python code must adopt the same changes
    * prove interoperability between golang and python3 code

2014-12-11
    * consolidate BitCount32/64() from hamt_go and bit_map_64.go
        into a file under xlUtil_go/math; this will subsume popCount3
        and popCount4(), which are currently not used anywhere else
    * eventually this will become a wrapper around a call to the C 
        language xlattice_c library

2014-11-08
    * mark NextExp2(), NextPow2() deprecated                            * DONE
    * delete in next development cycle

2014-05-10
    * need xlattice_go/cmd/gMerkleize/
