xl_util/TODO

2014-12-17
    * following Python, introduce SHA2 = sha256                         * DONE
    * move SHA{1,2,3}_LEN and USING_SHA{1,2,3} to xlUtil/const.go       * DONE
    * fix using code in merkletree/                                     * DONE
    * update github

    * introduce file format changes (possibly SHA name at end of 
        first line in file) to make distinguishing SHA2 from SHA3 
        possible)
        - python code must adopt the same changes
    * prove interoperability between golang and python3 code

2014-12-11
    * consolidate BitCount32/64() from hamt_go and bit_map_64.go
        into a file under xlUtil_go/math; this will subsume popCount3
        and popCount4(), which are currently not used anywhere else
    * eventually this will become a wrapper around a call to the C 
        language xlattice_c library

2014-11-08
    * implement NextExp2_32(), 32-bit version of NextExp2() and test    * DONE
    * implement NextExp2_64(), 64-bit version of NextPow2() and test    * DONE
    * implement NextPow2_32(), 32-bit version of NextPow2() and test    * DONE
    * implement NextPow2_64(), 64-bit version of NextPow2() and test    * DONE
    
    * mark NextExp2(), NextPow2() deprecated                            * DONE
    * delete in next development cycle

2014-11-05
    * URGENT math/NextPow2() needs cleaning up: it won't work sometimes * DONE

2014-10-16
    * lfs/CheckLFS() is too restrictive; change interface to            * DONE
        CheckLFS(path, perm) and then OR perm with 0700                 * DONE

2014-05-10
    * need xlattice_go/cmd/gMerkleize/
