    * gMerkleize ignores -t (showTimestamp) and -V (showVersion)
    * -M (match) and -X (exclude) have insufficient testing
    * gMerkleize needs to be tested on real file systems, companing
        results to merkleize
    * benchmark gMerkleize against Python versiobn, merkleize
    * gMerkleize is entirely single-threaded; 
        - introduce some concurrency 
        - benchmark against single-threaded version 
        - benchmark against merkleize

    * doTestPathlessUnboundConstructor() contains a fix which
        replaces a nil hash with an SHA1_LEN byte array of 
        nulls.  This fix won't even work if !usingSHA1.  FIX ME

    * connect doTestSHA in merkle_leaf_test.go to something!
    * MerkleTree.CreateFromFile() has not been translated

    * merkle_doc_test.go
        - write
        - get working
    * verify that exRE and matchRE are implemented and work in
        all components
    * code up gmerkleize as Go variant of Python merkleize
    * benchmark the two

    * consider adding GetPath/SetPath to MerkleNodeI interface

2013-10-06
    * all classes should have a func String() string implemented
        as in merkle_tree.go

2013-10-04
    * need 'typesafe' version of MerkleNode.Equal that skips the
        type checks
